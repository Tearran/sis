# Sensor API

A Python script to retrieve data from various sensors connected via I2C and output the data in JSON format.

The script will output the sensor data in JSON format.

## Future Supported Sensors
- BMP280 temperature and pressure sensor
- BME680 temperature, pressure, humidity, and gas sensor
- INA260 voltage, current, and power sensor
- System data (CPU temperature and uptime)
