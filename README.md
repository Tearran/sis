# SIS Architecture

SIS (Seamlessly Integrating Sensors) is a three-tiered system designed to seamlessly integrate sensors into a user-friendly interface. The system is made up of three main components:

1. [Frontend/ dashboard](#front)
2. [Logic Layer/Sensor Integration API (SenPI)](#senpi)
3. [another Database layer (AND)](#and)

## Concepts

The SIS architecture relies on several key concepts:

1. Sensors
3. Drivers
6. User Interface (UI)

## Frontend/dashboard<a name="front"></a>

The frontend layer is responsible for presenting the data to the user and allowing them to interact with the system. The user interface (UI) may be implemented using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, or other web technologies.

## Logic Layer/Sensor Integration API (SenPI) <a name="senpi"></a>

The logic layer is responsible for integrating the sensors into the system and passing the data. The algorithms and drivers are used to communicate with the sensors, and the data is processed and prepared reading.

## another Database layer (AND) <a name="and"></a>

The data layer is responsible for storing and retrieving data. The database is used to store the sensor data in a structured and efficient manner.
